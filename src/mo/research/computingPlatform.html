                                            System semiconductor is the key technology in the future-leading fields such as AI, HPC, and etc.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            While the industry is increasingly in need for high-performance computing devices, the current semiconductor technology faces a major challenge which indicates the end of Moore’s Law.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            We intend to overcome this challenge by developing an innovative semiconductor at system-level. Such system semiconductor requires convergence of various technologies enabling specialized architectures. For this, we seek technologies to design creative
                                            processors and build large-scale chiplets.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            Through our creative processor solution, we design a RISC-V CPU core which can be customized and optimized for given applications in terms of power, performance, and area (PPA).
                                            <br /><br />
                                            Through our large-scale chiplet solution, we build a scalable system with multiple processors and memories that can effectively maneuver the surge in data and workloads.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            Eventually, we expect these solutions to have the synergy that can lead beyond Moore’s Law.

                                            Recent deep learning models require enormous memory bandwidth to read/store huge amounts of weights and activations from/to memory devices. However, these data movements are very expensive in terms of system energy and latency.

                                            of AI accelerators and systems is being researched. As systems become more varied in scale and heterogenity, ensuring optimal performance from a system has become more challenging.

                                            To solve this problem, it is essential to conduct research on system software, including programming models, compilers, and runtimes. SAIT is currently focusing on researching a software stack that can support extreme scale, ranging from edge devices to
                                            data centers, and can handle heterogeneity where AI accelerators and in-memory processing units coexist. Additionally, our aim is to unify software optimization techniques like parallelization and scheduling by generalizing the optimization problem for
                                            various target hardware and systems. Furthermore, recent research at SAIT involves exploring deep learning-based compiler optimization to address the increasing search space of optimization problems as AI systems continue to grow in scale and complexity.

                                            Quantum computers, which operate under the principles of quantum mechanics, can perform complex calculations at an incredibly fast pace. This poses a threat to current cryptographic systems, which rely on complex mathematical principles and are thus
                                            difficult to crack using traditional computers. To address this issue, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is being researched extensively and is already commercially available. As quantum computing technology advances, PQC is expected to lead future security
