<p class="js-scr-box"><strong>Overview</strong> Electronic devices assembled by organic materials have recently received more attention in various applications related to light emission or absorption. The organic semiconductor materials used in these applications do not only manage and improve the performance of the device, but also influence the development direction of future electronic devices. Representative applications of electronic devices using organic semiconductor materials include light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), image sensors, memory chips , and stretchable devices.</p>
<img alt=" " class="js-scr-box" src="https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/webfile/webedit/20190802152030_02_09_02-02.jpg" />
<p class="js-scr-box"><strong>Technology Trend</strong> ① Display materials: OLED Device<br />
OLED is one of the most attractive display technologies and has several advantages. OLEDs can emit a wide range of colors and produce a deep black levels because there is no backlight which resulting in an infinite contrast ratio and a wide viewing angle. OLED displays also have a fast response time, wide color gamut, and low power consumption. One of the biggest advantages of OLED displays are that various concept designs can be made by harnessing its flexibility and transparency. These aspects are significant differentiators and are important in virtual-augmented reality devices and automotive displays. As a result, the demand of the organic semiconductor materials for panel production is growing rapidly. Perovskites as next generation display materials are attracting significant attention. With low cost and high color purity compared with LED, these materials are expected to lead to high quality displays with low production cost. Perovskite materials can not only easily realize various colors by halogen element substitutions, but one can also control the optical and electrical properties by simple substitution of organic/inorganic cations. These aspects may allow perovskites to have a significant impact on the future of the display material industry.<br />
<br />
② Semiconductor materials: Organic image sensor and Stretchable Device<br />
Organic materials can absorb the light of a specific wavelength even without a color filter. By making the sensor thinner with organic materials, more transistors can be configured in a limited area and the digital signal conversion and transmission speed can be accelerated. In addition, the light absorption can be easily adjusted through the control of the organic film thickness. For these reasons, organic image sensors are emerging as a powerful alternative to conventional silicon sensors. In the future, organic image sensors may replace Si-based sensors in applications that require precise and clear images, such as mobile digital cameras, autonomous navigation, industrial imaging, and security. Organic semiconductor materials are often flexible and stretchable, enabling new types of electronic devices with new form factors/use cases and displacing conventional silicon/metal sensors. In particular, the development of electronic skin products that are intimate contact with the human body can allow continuous and accurate monitoring of various bio-signals, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose level. We expect this to be one aspect that leads to the growth of the digital healthcare market based on IoT devices.</p>

<p class="js-scr-box"><strong>SAIT Technology</strong> SAIT is researching novel organic materials for OLED, perovskite, organic image sensor and e-skin applications. We are developing OLED materials with higher efficiency, longer lifetime, lower power consumption and better color purity. Our ultimate goal is to develop next-generation OLED materials that will lead the future display industry. Our perovskite research focuses on the development of new environmentally friendly perovskite materials and LEDs with high color purity and high efficiency. We are also currently developing organic-inorganic hybrid sensors that can maintain high resolution and high sensitivity, even in low-light situations. In particular, we have focused on developing organic materials that exhibit a photoelectric effect at specific wavelengths, contributing to the production of high-sensitivity, finepixel image sensors and next-generation large-area biometric sensors. In e-skin applications, we are conducting research on healthcare sensors and displays through the development of stretchable semiconductor materials. SAIT aims to change the future through realization of a new era of organic electronics by developing the foundational technologies that underpin the next generation of displays/sensors.</p>
