                                        technological limits and even to developing new types of electronic applications. Advanced thin film deposition techniques for complex oxides have indeed recently enabled exploring new phenomena and functionalities with atomically controlled interfaces where
                                        versatile electronic applications appear. New materials in the periodic table are now being synthesized by sophisticated chemical deposition techniques allowing a conformal coverage along the complex surface structure, which helps surmounting the scaling
                                        issues of memory devices. Coherent growth of oxide heterostructures, moreover, is expected to introduce new interface effects by atomic ordering and hence suppress or enhance some of materials properties which may in turn provide technological
                                        breakthroughs.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        <strong>Technology Trend</strong> The performance of a device even in the smallest node has seen drastic improvement mainly due to significant advancement of the lithographic technique. Taking advantage of shorter wavelengths of the incident light such as EUV,
                                        small line features down to 5-7 nm size in high-end logic circuitry have become possible. Delicate thin film techniques allow even further improvement on the microelectronic performances as well as in-depth understanding of the materials research itself. To
                                        solve the most important issue of scaling problems in memory and logic devices, however, further research on the fundamentals of materials only appears crucial.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        <strong>SAIT Technology</strong> We focus on developing new materials, multi-component oxide thin film in particular, for semiconductor technologies by studying the fundamentals of the materials while developing the thin film unit process. Compared to any
                                        other solid state compound systems, oxide thin films provide a richer playground for exploiting exotic physical phenomena. By establishing the encyclopedia of such materials by high throughput screening system, SAIT aims to lead the disruptive innovation in
                                        materials research and provide groundbreaking and unparalleled practical systems of materials.

                                        classical computing. Global IT companies such as IBM, Google, Intel, and Microsoft, along with several startups are engaged in active research and racing to realize this next generation technology.<br />
                                        The unit of information in a quantum computer is a qubit (quantum bit). N number of qubits can store 2^N units of information, and even a small to intermediate scale quantum computer with approximately 50 to 100 qubits is expected to outperform the currently
                                        available supercomputers in certain problems. These include modeling chemical processes, optimization, and artificial intelligence. Solving these problems are far beyond the capabilities of the most powerful supercomputers today. Quantum computers are expected
                                        to revolutionize the computing and introduce a new paradigm in future.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        <strong>Technology Trend</strong> IBM has already started offering quantum computing as a commercial cloud service with up to 20-quibit quantum computers, and several IT companies have also announced that 50 to 100-qubit devices are in testing. With increasing
                                        research effort, quantum computers with 100 qubits are expected to be available in the near future.<br />

                                        <strong>SAIT Technology</strong> At SAIT, our research is currently aiming at securing the basic technologies of quantum computing such as testing quantum algorithms, designing and fabricating qubits, and investigating qubit control mechanisms. In the long
                                        run, we are seeking strategies to develop our own quantum computers and gain a competitive edge in the race with global IT companies.

                                        <strong>Technology Trend</strong> For the TV applications, most micro-LED researches are focused on transferring individual R, G and B chips onto the TFT backplanes. However, such a chip-transfer approach is not suitable for high-density pixels-based displays
                                        such as AR-HUD and AR-glass.<br />

                                        devices, automobiles, and IOTs. Plenty of acoustic sensors are already installed in diverse ways of integration to recognize situation and context of surroundings. The machine learning technique integrated with the commodity microphones has contributed to
                                        accelerate the prevalence of the voice interface in a certain level so far. However, there still exists many acoustic challenges in maintaining the quality of sound signals in real world situations such as a high ambient noise, a far-field interface, and a
                                        cross interference environment. Though the array signal processing of cheaper multiple microphones has been a state-of-the-art technology, it normally requires a certain amount of computing and large baseline form factor. We expect that physical innovations in

                                        multiple transductions while legacy sensors gather information in a lump-sum which is then classified serially. This parallel processing is inherently fit to the neural-processing backend which results in high sensitivity and efficiency while allowing further
